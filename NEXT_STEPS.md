# Next Steps

Open work only. Tick steps as they land. When a milestone's gate passes, remove its section: `CHANGELOG.md` and git keep the history. Requirements and gates are in [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md), section 15.

## Current: Milestone 1, Identity and tenancy

**Gate:** two tenants and a tenant/twin pair fully isolated (integration); the ambiente rule covered for every deployment × mode cell; invite and role restrictions (E2E).

Before starting: decide the auth library (PRD open question 7) in an ADR, and read API ADRs 018 and 035 ([docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md)). Break the scope into steps here.

## Upcoming milestones

- [ ] 2. Entitlements and plans
- [ ] 3. SRI engine: factura
- [ ] 4. Other SRI documents
- [ ] 5. Inventory and purchasing
- [ ] 6. Sales
- [ ] 7. Bulk invoicing
- [ ] 8. Billing
- [ ] 9. Notifications, reports, admin
- [ ] 10. Production readiness and cutover
- [ ] 11+. Post-MVP: public API, API keys, webhooks, MCP, OAuth, developer docs

## Hardening backlog

Hardening deferred by an earlier milestone. Add an item whenever a milestone puts one off, with where it's recorded. Milestone 10 works through the list, and its gate needs it empty or each remaining item accepted by the owner.

- [ ] TLS for managed Postgres connections, verified against DigitalOcean (`docs/deployment.md`).
- [ ] Slimmer Docker image: 1.45 GB with the full `node_modules` (`Dockerfile`).
- [ ] Browser-side Sentry, with the DSN from the server at runtime (ADR-008).
- [ ] Moderate audit findings in Sentry's dependencies (`glob`, `minimatch`). Recheck on each Sentry upgrade.
- [ ] Automated dependency updates (Renovate or Dependabot).
- [ ] Revisit a separate role for system context: `app.rls_system` is a setting, not a privilege (ADR-004).
- [ ] pg-boss index rebuilds: automatic `REINDEX` is off, so bloat reports need a manual owner task (ADR-005).
- [ ] Web shutdown: stop pg-boss and close the pool on `SIGTERM`, as the worker does.

## Before the old repositories are deleted

The owner will delete `comprobify` and `comprobify-web`, so this repo must not depend on them (`CLAUDE.md`).

- [ ] Once porting is done, remove the porting map: PRD Appendix A, the old-ADR table in `docs/adr/README.md`, and the read-only references in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] Rewrite the remaining mentions of the old systems as self-contained history, and check that `git grep -E 'comprobify-web|\.\./comprobify|API ADR'` finds nothing that needs them.

## After the first Terraform deploy

- [ ] Owner makes `novaej/comprobify-erp` private. It stays public until then, because GitHub's free plan limits the permissions private repositories give the Terraform plan and apply workflows.
